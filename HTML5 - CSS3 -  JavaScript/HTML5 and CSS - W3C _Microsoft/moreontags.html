    <p>
      This is a paragraph. It may or may not be indented but it but there
      should be a line break at the end. Typically the last line will not stretch as far
      to the right as the rest of the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often there is extra space between one paragraph and the next.
    </p>

    <q>
      The <em> q </em> tag is for quotes.  This has no relationship to the somewhat confusing single
      and double quote characters, rather it's used when you want to quote a person or written work in your Web page.

      If you want to quote a larger passage, you may want to use blockquote, which will typically set the quoted
      text apart from the surrounding text and indent it, to make clear that it is quoted text.

      <h1>Page Heading &lt;pre&gt;</h1> <p>And here is the first paragraph    x</p>
 This is another tag that helps you break the white space rule.  PRE stands for "PREformatted text",
meaning "I've set this up just the way I want it, don't mess with it."  It generally implies a
monospace font, and none of the spaces, tabs or carriage-returns are ignored. It is very handy for
illustrating bits of program code, or other "typewritten" material
