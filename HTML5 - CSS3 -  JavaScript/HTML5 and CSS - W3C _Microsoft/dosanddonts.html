    <h1>This is the Beginning</h1>

    <!-- Case Sensitive -->
    <p id=ThisOne> <p id=thisone> ThisOne </p id=ThisOne>
      END of thisone

    <!-- All Equal -->
    <p id=MyName>
    <p id="MyName">
    <p id='MyName'>

      Case sensitive matters, except when it doesn't - case matters for some things, like strings and attributes, but not others, like tag names.
White space is ignored, except when it's not - White space is used to separate things, but adding more than one space will be the same as just one.  White space in strings is always just as you type it.
Quotation marks are not part of a string, except when they are - Quotation marks enclose a string, but thanks to the flexibility of choice between single or double quotes, it is easy to include one or the other in your string.
The important thing is to look good - You can take advantage of flexibility in capitalization and white space to make your code more readable and organized.
